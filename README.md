# Notes on Technical Books

This repository is dedicated to simply storing all notes I take while reading technical books.

The directory structure would look like this:
```
root
|
\__ Book 1
|   |
|   \__ Chapter 1
|   |   |
|   |   \__ code.py
|   |   |
|   |   \__ notes.md
|   |
|   \__ Chapter 2
|       |
|       \__ etc..
|
\__ Book 2
    |
    \__ etc..
```

Since problably all the books in the tech area has code that should be rewritten to fully understand it: I will be storing all the code (problably with comments in it) alogn with makrdown notes inside of each chapter directory.
